# CompositeFEA
Composite FEA MATLAB code from Undergrad Thesis

********** Operation Notes ***************
The maindriver.m file is the code that runs all of case studies of interest. 
"constructF ..." files are for building forcing vector depending on the element type
"elelaminatestiff ..." files are for building CLT element stiffness matrices used in FEA
"solve ..." files are for solving for displacement/rotational output given forcing input
